# Star Power: The Astrological News Reader - Revised Specification

## Elevator Pitch

A news reader app, for the astrologically minded.

## Executive Summary

Incorporates astrological insights to add greater context and meaning to current events. Utilizes artificial intelligence to gather information on key persons, places and things in current events, notably inception times and relationships for creation of natal charts, event charts and more. Users can customize their feed by following topics, and bookmark or tag articles they find. They can also submit stories for content review and vote on the accuracy/relevancy of a given story.

## What is the job to be done?

- Astrologers around the world love celebrity astrology as a way of exploring and validating their practice
- Most astrologers don't have the knowledge or time to perform proper astrological analysis on current events daily  
- We utilize AI to create a content-driven astrology product that delivers analysis at a rate no human can match

**Bonus:** We build and vet a generic astro-analysis engine that can be repurposed for future Astral Intuition LLC projects.

## Technical Architecture Notes

### AI Integration Requirements
#### Data Extraction
AI must reliably retrieve inception times, locations, and relationship data

#### Analysis Engine
Separate mathematical calculations from narrative generation

#### Quality Control
Use graphical RAG to minimize hallucination

#### Verification
Potentially use secondary AI to vet articles against graphical RAG

#### Volume Consideration
Low article throughput makes dual-AI verification feasible

### Content Pipeline
1. **Source Monitoring:** Automated news aggregation from multiple sources
2. **Relevance Filtering:** AI determines astrological significance
3. **Data Extraction:** Gather birth data, event times, location information
4. **Astrological Analysis:** Mathematical calculations and aspect analysis
5. **Narrative Generation:** AI writes human-readable astrology analysis
6. **Glyph Assignment:** Automated assignment of relevant enhanced Astro Glyphs
7. **Actor Recognition:** Identify and tag relevant people, places, organizations with celebrity highlighting
8. **Publication:** Release to appropriate topic tabs

### Data Storage Requirements
#### Actor Profiles
Birth data, astrological information, article associations

#### Article Archive
Full text, analysis, metadata, interaction data

#### User Preferences
Following lists, bookmarks, notification settings

#### Hashtag Index
Topic categorization and trend tracking

#### Interaction Analytics
Like counts, share data, engagement metrics

### AI Reliability for Data Extraction
#### Risk
Astro analysis depends heavily on AI to reliably retrieve data

#### Mitigation
- Thorough testing with baseline data sets

- Utilize graphical RAG to minimize hallucination
- Implement dual-AI verification system for critical data points
- Manual review process for high-profile articles

### User Engagement with Complex Astrological Concepts
