## Implementation Requirements

### Event Category Pills
- Use category color as background
- White text for contrast
- Proper contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum)
- Pills should be clearly readable

### Left Border Matching
- Left border should use the same color as the Event Category pill
- Creates visual connection between category and content

### Major Actor Highlighting
- Actor names (Taylor Swift, Elon Musk) should be colored using their content's category color
- Maintains visual hierarchy and category association

## Current Issues to Fix
- Event Category pills currently have white background with white text (invisible)
- Need to apply the defined category colors to make content scannable
- Left borders need to inherit the category color theme

This color system will create visual consistency and help users quickly identify content types while maintaining accessibility standards.
