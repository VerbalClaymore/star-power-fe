# Bottom Nav
## Offset 
The bottom nav seems to shift when I go from Celeb Profile to Home. They may be slightly off.

This also doesn't have the bottom nav available. It should be added here as well.

# Houses
Change the subtitle from House X to a brief summary of what the house represents: 

| 1   | Self                  |
| --- | --------------------- |
| 2   | Wealth                |
| 3   | Siblings and Routines |
| 4   | Family and Home       |
| 5   | Creation and Joy      |
| 6   | Service               |
| 7   | Others                |
| 8   | Wealth of Others      |
| 9   | The Quest             |
| 10  | Career                |
| 11  | Network               |
| 12  | Hidden Enemies        |



There is a lot of white space here. Remove the "Mercury 8" or "Sun 15". We're really just showing the contents of the houses, not the specific degree. Note that there may be multiple planets in the same house.

# Stars
You should list the fields left to right with equal emphasis. The zodiac sign should be  on the same row. Preferred format: {Planet Icon, Planet Name, Planet Zodiac Sign, Planet Degree}

This should reduce the verticality of the tab so that we can see all planets without scrolling.

# Vibes
* Let's recreate the different vibrations as spindowns
	* Each Vibration has a Roman NUmeral in the chart below
	* When expanded, it shows one or more circuits of planets, and a brief one line description of what it means.
* Note that some vibrations will be empty, that is a case we need to handle
