We are adding new tabs to the Celeb Profile Page, we need to make some space on the page to allow this. 

# Compress Header
Presently we show the Celeb Name, Celeb Image, and category in a topmost card. 
We also have Astrological Blueprint with Sun Moon and Rising signs. This could be compressed. Remove the "Astrological Blueprint" text and make the Sun/Moon/Rising part of a single card with the Celeb Name/Image/Category at the top

# New: Tabs
We're  going to move out each of the following subsections into their own tabs. The tabs should appear directly under the compressed header that we established above. 

## FORMAT: Current Section Name --> New Tab Name
Relationships  --> Relationships
* Just move this section over to that tab for now, no other changes.

Vibrational Astrology Circuits --> Vibes
* Just move this section over to that tab for now, no other changes.
Traditional Astrology --> Stars
* A Stars tab which indicates star positions. 
* I expect 10 rows (one for each planet)
* It should list the Zodiac Sign and Degree of each of the major bodies: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto
Traditional Astrology --> Houses
* A Houses tab which indicates star positions.
* I expect 12 rows (one for each house), where the first row's Zodiac sign is the Rising Sign of the chart
	* On each row, list the Zodiac sign, any Planets it contains, and the degree of the planet
* It should depict which planet is in which zodiac sign
* I expect 12 rows, where the first row's Zodiac sign is the Rising Sign of the chart
	* On each row, list the Zodiac sign, any Planets it contains, and the degree of the planet

Current Planetary Transits --> Transits
* Just move this section over to that tab for now, no other changes.

# Planet Iconography Consistency
Let's establish consistent colors / icons for the planets: 
* Mercury: Tan
* Venus: Yellowish White
* Mars: Rust
* Jupiter: Banded Red / Yellow / White 
* Saturn: Blue with a ring
* Uranus: Pale Blue with a Ring
* Neptune: Pale greenish Blue
* Pluto: Purple

Note that we will convert these into images once we bring on an artist so it may be useful to make them images now. 
# Bottom Nav
It also seems like we lost the Bottom Nav on the Celeb Profile page (Home,Profile,Saved,Search). We should bring that back to maintain consistency.
