# Relationship Profile
## Context
We are introducing a new structure: Relationships. This represents a relationship between two celebrities. i.e. Ben Affleck + Jennifer Lopez is the "Bennifer" ship, or Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are the... Tayvis ship. It reuses a lot of the structure from Celebrities, but treats the relationship as a singular entity.

Behavior

Create Ship Profile with "Ship Profile" as the title

# Metatag List View
**Behavior**
When the user taps on any metatag, display a variant of the List View where all articles containing that metatag are displayed. 
It should still be sorted newest to oldest by default.

# Dark Mode and Dark Mode Toggle
We need a Dark Mode. I should be able to toggle it from the List View page. Put it on the upper right there. Make an icon that changes from a sun to a moon. 

# Asset List
I'd like to take a pass at proper images for all of the placeholdered art. I need this formatted or organized in some way that makes sense for when I have Canva try to create assets for us. Maybe a spreadsheet will be the best format here.

# Misc.
## Back Button Behavior
When the user hits the back button, it should return to the previously viewed page. Currently the back button sometimes returns to the "Home" (List View) page. This is incorrect.

Timeline
This is a mobile first app, but I'm developing on PC. The timelines are hard to debug here; I'm not sure if this because all the articles are from 2025 or because I can't tap-drag the timeline on a PC? For Travis, Taylor, and Kanye create dummy articles from 2024 and 2023, that will make it easier to test.
